<h1> INFO </h1>
<p>A game's lover. I have always known my future would be 100% related to games, but it is a dream coming true that I can make part of their development.</p>

<p>My name is Carlos Menezes Concencio, I love games and I got into the world of gaming development around 2017 when I moved away from my hometown to start studying on the other side of the country. In the beginning I was afraid of this world I was discovering under the games that I have always played, I thought it would be too hard, but today I feel like it really changed the way I see every single action in games. Every event, every effect, every animation. Each one of these little things that are part of creating a game makes me want to be a part of it even more.<p/>
